# Eniac's Market Entry into Brazil: A Magist Partnership Analysis

This repository contains the project presentation for the "Data Science" course at WBS School, focusing on Eniac's potential expansion into the Brazilian market through a partnership with Magist. The presentation discusses the challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for this market entry strategy.

## Project Overview

Eniac, a tech product retailer, is considering expanding into the Brazilian market. Brazil offers a significant eCommerce revenue potential, but Eniac faces challenges due to a lack of local connections and market knowledge. The board of directors has set a one-year timeline for the expansion.

Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service company, offers centralized order management, connecting small and medium-sized stores with major Brazilian marketplaces. They also provide post-sales services like stock and warehouse management, product shipment, and customer service related to shipments.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. Evaluate the feasibility and benefits of partnering with Magist in Eniac's expansion into Brazil.
2. Analyze the compatibility of Magist's services with Eniac's tech product catalogue.
3. Assess the efficiency of Magist's delivery services for ensuring customer satisfaction.

## Data Analysis

To address these goals, we have obtained access to a snapshot of Magist's database. Our analysis focuses on the following aspects:

### 1. Market Compatibility

We will examine the extent to which Magist's services align with Eniac's tech product catalogue. This analysis will help determine whether Magist is a suitable partner for high-end tech products.

### 2. Delivery Efficiency

We will investigate the speed and efficiency of deliveries facilitated by Magist's partnership with the public Post Office. This is crucial for Eniac, as fast deliveries are a key factor in ensuring customer satisfaction.

### 3. Market Entry Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we will provide recommendations to the board of directors on the feasibility of partnering with Magist and the potential strategies for Eniac's market entry into Brazil.
